# Black Jack Game
Heyo, this is my version of the famous black jack game. I brought this game to life using javascript. The game template/markups is created with html and css to add styling and personality to it.

Click <a href="http://ijordan.tech/javascript-blackjack-game/">Here</a> to play blackjack game

#### Rules 
On start player draws 2 random cards

If player's cards sum up to 24 then he has blackjack and has won. On the contrary if a player's cards sum up to a number greater than 24 then the player is out of the game and has loss.

While the player's cards sum up to a number less than 24, the player is called to draw a new card.
